## 2026-08-26 — B. Boring Vanilla

- Starting work time: 2026-08-26 21:31:42 UTC
- Project: VCSSERG v1 (`vcsserg-repo-v1`)
- Planned scope: Audit the current static site and implement one foundational Version 1.0 slice, then validate, document, commit, push, and deploy it.
- Work completed:
  - Replaced the placeholder home page with a semantic public front door describing Virtual CSSERG's purpose and linking its current project and scholar.
  - Replaced B. Boring Vanilla's placeholder with a complete scholar profile and current-project link.
  - Created the public VCSSERG v1 project page.
  - Created one dependency-free responsive stylesheet shared by all pages, including keyboard focus treatment, a skip link, and reduced-motion support.
  - Updated `STATE.md` with the current implementation, limitations, important files, and next steps.
- Validation:
  - A repository-local HTML parser checked all 3 pages for language, title, main landmark, H1, duplicate IDs, local files, and fragments; all checks passed.
  - CSS brace-balance, responsive-breakpoint, and reduced-motion checks passed.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
- Problems encountered: The sandbox prohibits opening a local HTTP socket, and no headless browser package is installed, so browser-rendered visual QA was not possible in this iteration. File-level structural and link checks were used instead.
- Question for Dr. Jones: Beyond the documented scholar workflow and public site, are there specific behaviors you consider mandatory for Version 1.0?
- Proposed next step: Build a documentation-to-implementation checklist, then visually QA this foundation and address the highest-value uncovered workflow gap.
- Ending work time: 2026-08-26 21:38:57 UTC
- Post-iteration operations (2026-08-26 21:40:02 UTC): The required commit could not be created because the environment mounts `.git` read-only (`.git/index.lock`: read-only file system). Push and deployment were therefore not attempted; deploying an uncommitted, unpushed tree would violate the required operation order. All work remains present in the working tree for completion from a Git-writable environment.
